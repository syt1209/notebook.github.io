#### **Main takeways**
1. _Puzzle: The Fox, the Goose, and the Corn_ 
    - Thinking about the problem in the most **general terms** 
    - Generate all possible sequences of operations, ending each sequence once it violates one of our **constraints** or reaches a configuration we’ve seen before
    - The inherent difficulty will be sidestepped through the formal restatement of **constraints and operations**.

    > **_Restating the problem in a more formal manner is a great technique for gaining insight into a problem._**
