### Research Data Management

* **Research data**– the recorded factual material commonly accepted in the scientific community as necessary to validate research findings.
* **Research data management** – storage, access, and preservation of data produced from a given investigation.
* **Data** **for reproducibility**= **appraising data** (underlying published results) + **metadata/documentation** (contextual details about the data sets) + **code/scripts** (associated with analyses and results)
* **Lifecycle: <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Plan  → Collect → Assure → Describe → Preserve → Discover → Integrate → Analyze → Plan</span>**
    * **Plan**
        * File naming convention
        * Standard way for structuring folder directories
        * Community standard for naming and describing data elements
        * Reporting standards and minimum information standards to record sufficient contextual information
        * Optimal file formats for storage and archiving, and formats optimal for dissemination, access, use, and reuse
        * Explore data sharing repositories early 
    * **Describe**
        * Controlled vocabulary for naming data elements
        * Standards for defining values
        * Data dictionaries
        * Readme files
        * Codebooks
        * Minimum information and reporting standards
    * **Preserve access (repositories and data centers)**
        * Disciplinary repositories
        * Repositories built around methods
        * Federally-funded repositories and data centers
        * Institutional repositories
        * Open repositories
        * Data enclave options for sensitive data sets
    * **Discover (publishing and citing data)**
        * Obtaining digital object identifiers (DOIs) for data sets
        * Other identifiers: accession number (NCBI), clinical trial registry numbers (NCT)
        * Citing data sets and their location in publications and presentations along with funding source, grant proposals, etc.
        * Assigning a license defining terms of use
        * Ensuring sensitive data sets meet IRB standards for consent and de-identification
        * Deposit after appropriate embargoing for publication, intellectual property, or security
* **Data policies**
    * Data ownership and intellectual property**
    * Data management and stewardship responsibilities**
    * Public access, data sharing, and dissemination**
    * Retention**
