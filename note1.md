#### Research Data Management

* **Research data**– the recorded factual material commonly accepted in the scientific community as necessary to validate research findings.
* **Research data management** – storage, access, and preservation of data produced from a given investigation.
* **Data** **for reproducibility**= **appraising data** (underlying published results) + **metadata/documentation** (contextual details about the data sets) + **code/scripts** (associated with analyses and results)
* **Lifecycle: <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Plan  → Collect → Assure → Describe → Preserve → Discover → Integrate → Analyze → Plan</span>**
    * **Plan**
        * File naming convention
        * Standard way for structuring folder directories
        * Community standard for naming and describing data elements
        * Reporting standards and minimum information standards to record sufficient contextual information
        * Optimal file formats for storage and archiving, and formats optimal for dissemination, access, use, and reuse
        * Explore data sharing repositories early 
    * **Describe**
        * Controlled vocabulary for naming data elements
        * Standards for defining values
        * Data dictionaries
        * Readme files
        * Codebooks
        * Minimum information and reporting standards
    * **Preserve access (repositories and data centers)**
        * Disciplinary repositories
        * Repositories built around methods
        * Federally-funded repositories and data centers
        * Institutional repositories
        * Open repositories
        * Data enclave options for sensitive data sets
    * **Discover (publishing and citing data)**
        * Obtaining digital object identifiers (DOIs) for data sets
        * Other identifiers: accession number (NCBI), clinical trial registry numbers (NCT)
        * Citing data sets and their location in publications and presentations along with funding source, grant proposals, etc.
        * Assigning a license defining terms of use
        * Ensuring sensitive data sets meet IRB standards for consent and de-identification
        * Deposit after appropriate embargoing for publication, intellectual property, or security
* **Data policies**
    * Data ownership and intellectual property
    * Data management and stewardship responsibilities
    * Public access, data sharing, and dissemination
    * Retention

* **Data types**
    * **_Raw data_**: What is being measured or observed? This is the data that is being generated during the research project. 
    * **_Processed data_**: How can the raw data be made useful/manipulable?
    * **_Analyzed data_**: What does the data tell us? Is it significant? How so?
    * **_Finalized/published data_**: How does the data support your research question?
    * **_Derived or compiled data_** is reproducible but expensive. Examples include 'Data mining', 'Compiled databases', and '3D models'.
    * **_Observational data_** is captured in real time, usually irreplaceable (sensor readings, telescope images, sample data)
    * **_Experimental data_** is obtained from lab equipment, often reproducible but can be expensive (gene sequences, chromatograms)
    * **_Simulation data_** is generated from test models where models and metadata are more important than output data (climate models)

* **Trade secrets** are not considered research data because they must be held confidential by a researcher until they are published, and are protected under law.

* **Medical information** or other information that could be used to identify a particular person in a research study are not considered research data because if disclosed, it would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.

* **Data Management Plans (DMPs)** cover all stages of the data life cycle.

* **Spreadsheets and databases** relate to data discovery, collection and organization.

* **Data types and laboratory methods** should be documented for data quality assurance and control.

* **Policies** should be consulted when addressing data preservation and dissemination plans for data sharing.
