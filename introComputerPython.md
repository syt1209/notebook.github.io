#### What is computation

* How to program?
    * represent knowledge with **data structure**
    * **iteration** and **recursion** (control flow)
* How to write "good" code with "good" style?
    * **abstraction** of procedures and data types
    * **organized** and **modular** using object classes and methods
* How to determine program efficiency?
    * **algorithms**
    * **complexity** of algorithms

##### **_What does computer do?_**
* Perform calculations
    * built-in to the language
    * defined by the programmer
* Storage of results

##### **_Types of knowledge_**
* Declarative knowledge -- **statements of fact**
* Imperative knowledge -- **recipe** or **how-to**
    * **What is a RECIPE?**
        1. sequence of simple **steps**
        2. **flow of control** process that specifies when each step is executed
        3. a means of determining **when to stop**
